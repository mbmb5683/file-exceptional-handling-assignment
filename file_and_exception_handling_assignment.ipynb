        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Compiled Language: in compiled language it first converts the source code into machine code\n",
        "\n",
        "  Interpreted language: in interpreted language source code are directly executed without compilation of code and in this code is executed line by line.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Exceptional Handling: as we can understand by the name only that in suspecious line of code are handled by using try catch block to just avoid the error.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Finally Block: As we all know that even after execution of except block finally block will execute it cannot get stopped even after the error raise.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Logging: Logging is a most commom concept in python that is used to define the error by the levels like DEBUG, INFO , ERROR, CRITICAL...\n",
        "They just create the log file and show the level of error in the log file .\n",
        "\n",
        "5. DEL: del method in python is used to delete the directory but only if the directory is empty otherwise we have to import a module that is \"shutil\" to delete the hirarchy of the directory.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. import: import is used to import the modules form the package\n",
        "   from...import: from ... import means we are just importing the module form the package it belongs.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Multiple Exception : When the multiple exception arises first we create the except block of specified error and then at last we create the final except block that contain all the exception in it that is : \"except Exception as e:\" this except block contains all type of error.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. With Statement: when we want to read the contain of the file we have to close the file then only we can read the content of the file but when we use \"with statement\" then we don't have to close the file it understand that after opening or reading the file the is automatically closed . just to avoid the corruption of file, file lock... etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Multithreading : In multithreading we divide the processes into multiple threads that runs concurrently in the processor just to manage the memory .\n",
        "In multithreading sharing of resources aur memory space is also done.\n",

        "Multiprocessing: In multiprocessing the are multiple processor to execute the process . In multiprocessor processes are runs parallely.\n",

        "\n",
        "10. Advantage of logging: Logging is used to categorise the message severity level.\n",
        "it also create the log file when an error generates without stopping the execution of code.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "11. Memory Management: Memory management is just a concept in which we handle the memory space, Execution time by using the multithreading and multiprocessing to get the executon time very less.\n",

        "\n",
        "15. python Garbage collection: ChatGPT said:\n",
        "Python’s garbage collection system is responsible for automatically managing memory — freeing up memory that’s no longer being used by the program. This helps avoid memory leaks and keeps your program efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "16. Else: Else block is used in exceptio handling just to seperate the exceptional handling it means that just write the suspecious code in try except block and the safe code in else block just to make the code more understandable and easier and else block is also executed when no error raised.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",

Closing the file: if we don't close the file then we have face when we try to read the files it will throw an error, we will be unable to read the content of the file , it will also corrupt the file sometimes, and file lock so to avoid this type of problem that's why we close the file . and in python if we don't close the file after writting the file then we can't open the file as read mode.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. file.read () : in this we read the content of the file in one go .\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "22. os module: os module is used to interact with the operating system . when our program have to interact with our operating system to access the file or data from our device then at that time we have to import the os module to our code.\n",
